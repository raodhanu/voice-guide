## üöÄ Running the Application Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run the VoiceGuide application on your local machine:

### Prerequisites
1. Node.js (v16+) and npm installed
2. Python 3.8+ installed
3. Visual Studio Code with Python and JavaScript/TypeScript extensions

### Backend Setup
1. Open a terminal in VS Code and navigate to the project root
2. Create a Python virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - Mac/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install the backend dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   ```
5. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your API keys:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key
   ```
6. Run the backend server:
   ```
   cd backend
   uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
   ```

### Frontend Setup
1. Open a new terminal (keep the backend running)
2. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```
3. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
5. The application should now be running at http://localhost:5173/

### Notes
- For the Google Maps functionality to work properly, ensure your API key has the appropriate permissions
- Speech recognition works best in Chrome and Edge browsers
- For best results, use a microphone in a quiet environment
